- funny type game
- 4 golden melodies to collect
- the game gets harder as we collect melodies
- ennemies coming out of the ground, and following you to attack you.
- ennemies are cowboy gedagedi.
- when the ennemies are coming they emit a brain rot sound (country club music or smh like that)
- ranch like map (cowboy village)
- 3 puzzles to do in order to get the 3 melodies one by one
- the puzzles are objectifs that we need to accomplish like finding a specific item in the cowboy village...
- For the last melody we need to fight a boss when he gets into his last form (about 30% health left) he shoots infinite nuggets synced with a melody.
- the first ennemies come from everywhere or on the ground and they spawn on a certain radius from the player
- audio increases as the we collect the golden medolies
